# Shrub Hub

## Description
Shrub Hub is a website that allows users to upload images and information about thier own house plant collections, as well as view and comment on other users' plants. 

## Motivation
The motivation for creating this website was to practice some of the skills I had recently developed during my coding boot camp. In particular, I wanted to revisit creating a full-stack web application which uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern while also practicing using MySQL as the database language along with a template engine (Handlebars.js).

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Express.js
* MySQL
* Handlebars.js (template engine used in place of HTML)
* Bcrypt (for user authentication)
* Multer (for handling image uploads)

## Future Improvements
* Add an "About" section, either on the homepage or as its own page. As of now it is currently unclear what the purpose of the website is to the user if they are looking at it for the first time.
* Allow users to upload profile pictures.
* Allow users to view other users' profiles, as well as their activity.
* Add likes so that users can like one another's plant posts.
* Add functionality to auto-resize images that are uploaded by users, so that the plant cards can accommodate them without being aestheticall displeasing.
